				"The United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the United Nations which is responsible for ensuring and maintaining international peace and security. The security council may engage in the prevention and resolution of disputes that occur, they can mandate peace operations in order to provide a variety of support solely with the purpose of maintaining peace and stability and protecting civilians, or even preventing an armed conflict and any other forms of violence that breaches this councilâ€™s responsibility. The council is composed of 15 members, five permanent members: China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The permanent members of this council hold veto power, which has been regarded over the rumor that the council is often paralyzed by political disagreements among its members. Overall, the UNSC plays a critical role in maintaining global peace and security, although its effectiveness is limited by the complexities and political realities of its members",
